Don't try this at home!!!

This aims at find the correlation between the price movement of a certain stock with that of a certain commodity.
If this kind of correlation is proven to be strong and significant, it could be used for multiple purposes,
including hedging, predicting one's price movement base on another one's movement.

But I am just a beginner and I don't have access to plenty of data
I might try to get access to the Bloomberg Terminal at school

Good idea!

Today's self talking is over, time to sleep.
